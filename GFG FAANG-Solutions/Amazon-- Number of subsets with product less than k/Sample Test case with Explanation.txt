Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {2, 4, 5, 3}
K = 12
Output:
8
Explanation:
All possible subsets whose 
products are less than 12 are:
(2), (4), (5), (3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 3), (4, 3)


Example 2:
Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {9, 8, 3}
K = 2 
Output:
0
Explanation:
There is no subsets with product less
than or equal to 2.
